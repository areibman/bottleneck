## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Storage
- **Primary**: Zustand store with persistence middleware
- **Backup**: Electron settings store
- **Format**: JSON with the following structure:

```typescript
interface AuthorTeam {
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  name: string;            // Display name
  members: string[];       // Array of GitHub usernames
  description?: string;    // Optional description
  color?: string;          // Hex color code
  icon?: string;           // Team icon (default: 🏢)
  createdAt: string;       // ISO timestamp
  lastUsed?: string;       // ISO timestamp
}
```

### Store Methods
- `createTeam(teamData)` - Create new team
- `updateTeam(id, updates)` - Update existing team
- `deleteTeam(id)` - Remove team
- `getTeam(id)` - Retrieve team by ID
- `markTeamAsUsed(id)` - Update last used timestamp
- `exportTeams()` - Export all teams as JSON string
- `importTeams(data)` - Import teams from JSON string

### Filter Integration
- Teams expand to individual author selections
- Works seamlessly with existing filter logic
- Maintains compatibility with "All Authors" toggle
- Supports combining multiple teams
- Shows indeterminate state for partial selections

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify team appears in author dropdown
- [ ] Select team and verify all members are selected
- [ ] Deselect one member and verify indeterminate state

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. Teams stored locally (not synced across devices)
2. Team members must exist in current repo's PR authors
3. No enforced maximum team size
4. No team name uniqueness validation (allows duplicates)
5. Requires TypeScript types to be installed for development
