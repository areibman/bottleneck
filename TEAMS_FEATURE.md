# Team Management Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added the ability to pre-save "teams" (combinations of authors) that can be quickly selected from the author filter dropdown in the PR list view.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Teams Store (`src/renderer/stores/teamsStore.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages author team configurations with persistent storage
- **Key Functions**:
  - `createTeam`: Create new author teams
  - `updateTeam`: Edit existing teams
  - `deleteTeam`: Remove teams
  - `markTeamAsUsed`: Track team usage
  - `exportTeams`: Export teams as JSON
  - `importTeams`: Import teams from JSON

- **Team Structure**:
  ```typescript
  {
    id: string;              // Unique identifier
    name: string;            // Display name (e.g., "Frontend Team")
    members: string[];       // GitHub usernames
    description?: string;    // Optional description
    color?: string;          // Team color for visual identification
    icon?: string;           // Team icon
    createdAt: string;       // Creation timestamp
    lastUsed?: string;       // Last usage timestamp
  }
  ```

### 2. Team Management Dialog (`src/renderer/components/TeamManagementDialog.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: UI for creating and editing teams
- **Features**:
  - Name and describe teams
  - Select multiple authors with search functionality
  - Choose team colors for visual identification
  - Edit existing teams
  - Delete teams
  - Export all teams to JSON file
  - Import teams from JSON

### 3. Enhanced Author Filter Dropdown (`src/renderer/views/PRListView.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Display and select teams in the author filter
- **UI Structure**:
  ```
  Author Filter:
  ├── All Authors
  ├── Teams (if any exist)
  │   ├── [Team Color] Team Name (3 members)
  │   │   └── Edit button (on hover)
  │   └── [Team Color] Another Team (5 members)
  ├── ➕ Create New Team...
  └── Individual Authors
      ├── @author1
      └── @author2
  ```

### 4. Team Selection Logic
- **Single-click filtering**: Click a team checkbox to select/deselect all members
- **Indeterminate state**: Shows partial selection if some (but not all) team members are selected
- **Smart selection**: Selecting all authors via teams updates "All Authors" checkbox
- **Usage tracking**: Teams are marked as "last used" when selected

## User Benefits

1. **Time Saving**: Filter by entire teams with one click instead of selecting multiple authors
2. **Consistency**: Use the same groupings across sessions
3. **Organization**: Named teams are clearer than username lists
4. **Flexibility**: Quickly switch between team views
5. **Collaboration**: Share team configurations via export/import
6. **Visual Identification**: Color-coded teams for quick recognition

## Usage Instructions

### Creating a Team
1. Open the author filter dropdown in PR List view
2. Click "Create New Team..."
3. Enter team name and optional description
4. Select team color
5. Search and select team members
6. Click "Create Team"

### Using a Team
1. Open the author filter dropdown
2. Click the checkbox next to any team
3. All team members will be instantly selected
4. PRs will filter to show only those authors

### Editing a Team
1. Open the author filter dropdown
2. Hover over a team and click "Edit"
3. Modify team details or members
4. Click "Update Team"

### Importing/Exporting Teams
1. Open team creation/edit dialog
2. Expand "Import/Export Teams" section
3. Click "Export All Teams" to download JSON
4. Paste JSON and click "Import" to add teams

## Technical Implementation

### Storage
- Teams are stored in Zustand store with persistence middleware
- Teams sync to Electron settings store for cross-session persistence
- Uses localStorage as fallback in web environments

### Filter Integration
- Teams integrate seamlessly with existing author filter logic
- Team members are expanded into individual author selections
- Works with "All Authors" toggle and individual selections
- Maintains filter state across navigation

### UI/UX Design
- Teams section appears between "All Authors" and individual authors
- Color indicators help visually distinguish teams
- Member count shows team size at a glance
- Indeterminate checkboxes show partial selections
- Edit button appears on hover for quick access
- Responsive dialog with search functionality

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
1. `/workspace/src/renderer/stores/teamsStore.ts` - Team management store
2. `/workspace/src/renderer/components/TeamManagementDialog.tsx` - Team dialog UI

### Modified Files
1. `/workspace/src/renderer/views/PRListView.tsx` - Added team UI and logic

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Team Templates**: Pre-defined templates for common team structures
2. **Team Sharing**: Share teams via URL or QR code
3. **Team Analytics**: Track which teams are used most frequently
4. **Dynamic Teams**: Auto-update teams based on repository contributors
5. **Team Icons**: Custom emoji/icon selection for teams
6. **Nested Teams**: Support for sub-teams or team hierarchies
7. **Team Presets**: Quick filters like "My Teams", "Recently Used"
8. **Drag & Drop**: Reorder teams in the dropdown
9. **Team Permissions**: Limit who can edit certain teams (enterprise)
10. **Cross-repo Teams**: Use same teams across multiple repositories

## Testing Recommendations

1. Create a team with 2-3 members
2. Verify team appears in author filter dropdown
3. Select team and verify all members are selected
4. Deselect individual member and verify indeterminate state
5. Edit team to add/remove members
6. Export teams and reimport in fresh session
7. Delete team and verify it's removed
8. Test with no teams (should show "Create Team..." button)
9. Test color picker and verify colors display correctly
10. Test search functionality in team dialog

## Known Limitations

1. Teams are stored locally per user (not synced across devices)
2. Team members must exist in current repository's PR authors
3. Maximum team size not enforced (could impact performance with very large teams)
4. No team name uniqueness validation (allows duplicate names)

## Accessibility

- All interactive elements are keyboard navigable
- Checkboxes support standard keyboard controls
- Color is not the only indicator (team names always visible)
- Dialog can be closed with Escape key
- Focus management in dialogs

## Performance Considerations

- Team expansion happens in O(n) time where n = number of team members
- Teams are loaded once on app initialization
- No API calls required (local storage only)
- Minimal re-renders due to memoized callbacks and useMemo
