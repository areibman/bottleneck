# Label Filter Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive label filtering feature added to the Bottleneck PR management application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Label Filter State Management (`uiStore.ts`)
Added new state properties to `UIState`:
- `selectedLabels: string[]` - Array of selected label names
- `labelFilterMode: LabelFilterMode` - Filter logic mode (OR, AND, NOT, ONLY)
- `showNoLabels: boolean` - Toggle to show PRs without any labels

### 2. LabelFilterDropdown Component (`LabelFilterDropdown.tsx`)
A fully-featured dropdown component with:

#### Filter Modes
- **OR (Any)**: Shows PRs with any of the selected labels (default)
- **AND (All)**: Shows PRs with all selected labels
- **NOT (Exclude)**: Excludes PRs with selected labels
- **ONLY (Exactly)**: Shows PRs with exactly these labels (no more, no less)

#### Features
- **Search functionality**: Filter through label list with real-time search
- **Quick filters section**: Common labels (bug, feature, documentation, etc.) displayed prominently with emojis
- **Label count display**: Shows how many PRs have each label
- **Visual label chips**: Labels displayed with their GitHub colors using proper contrast
- **Sort by usage**: Labels sorted by most frequently used first
- **No labels option**: Special filter to show PRs without any labels
- **Clear all functionality**: Quick button to clear all label filters

#### UI/UX Enhancements
- Color-coded labels matching GitHub's label colors
- Emoji support for common label types (🐛 bug, ✨ feature, 📝 docs, etc.)
- Responsive dropdown with scrolling for many labels
- Filter mode selector with detailed descriptions
- Selected labels highlighted with ring indicator in quick filters

### 3. PRListView Integration
Updated `PRListView.tsx` to integrate label filtering:

#### Available Labels Collection
- Automatically collects all unique labels from PRs in the current repository
- Tracks usage count for each label
- Updates dynamically when PRs are loaded

#### Filtering Logic
Comprehensive filtering that supports all four modes:
```typescript
// OR mode: PR has at least one of the selected labels
labelMatches = selectedLabels.some(label => prLabelNames.includes(label));

// AND mode: PR has all of the selected labels
labelMatches = selectedLabels.every(label => prLabelNames.includes(label));

// NOT mode: PR doesn't have any of the selected labels
labelMatches = !selectedLabels.some(label => prLabelNames.includes(label));

// ONLY mode: PR has exactly the selected labels (no more, no less)
labelMatches = selectedLabels.length === prLabelNames.length &&
  selectedLabels.every(label => prLabelNames.includes(label));
```

#### Visual Chips Display
- Selected labels displayed as removable chips below the filter bar
- Shows current filter mode (e.g., "Filtering by labels (OR):")
- Individual X buttons to remove specific labels
- "Clear all" button to reset label filters
- "No labels" chip when filtering by PRs without labels

### 4. Filter Integration
Label filters work seamlessly with existing filters:
- Author filters
- Status filters (open, draft, merged, closed)
- Sort options (by updated, by created)

All filters are applied together with AND logic between filter types, meaning:
- Author filter AND Status filter AND Label filter must all match

## User Workflow

### Basic Usage
1. Click the "Labels:" dropdown in the PR list header
2. Select one or more labels from the list
3. PRs are filtered immediately to show only matching items
4. Selected labels appear as chips below the header

### Advanced Usage
1. Use search box to find specific labels quickly
2. Click quick filter badges for common labels
3. Change filter mode to AND/NOT/ONLY for advanced filtering
4. Toggle "No labels" to find unlabeled PRs
5. Remove individual labels by clicking X on their chips
6. Clear all filters at once with "Clear all" button

## Technical Details

### State Persistence
Label filter state is managed in Zustand store with localStorage persistence (theme, sidebar state).
Label filter selections persist during the session but reset on app restart.

### Performance
- Efficient filtering using JavaScript Set operations
- Memoized label collection and filtering logic
- Minimal re-renders with React.useMemo

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation supported
- Click-outside to close dropdown
- Proper ARIA labels (can be enhanced further)

## Files Modified

   - Added to initial state and reset function

2. **`src/renderer/components/LabelFilterDropdown.tsx`** (NEW)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Persist label filter selections across sessions
2. Save favorite label combinations
3. Label-based saved views/presets
4. Keyboard shortcuts for common label filters
5. Bulk PR operations based on labels
